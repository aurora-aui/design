# Aurora AUI (Aural User Interface)

Aurora is an experimental research project to explore the creation of a user
interface that is purely audio-based. Rather than working to make existing
apps "accessible", we aim to create a new ecosystem that is designed to be
used without a mouse or screen. By designing a suite of apps, system services,
and user interface components specifically for people who can't see, we aim to
provide blind and visually-impaired users a computing experience better than
anything they've ever used before.

At the moment, there is no actual code for the Aurora AUI. It is still just a
concept. Much design work is needed before we can get to the point of writing
code. This repository is intended to store Aurora's design documentation
once there are some designs to document. It is also intended to be a forum
where designs can be brainstormed.
